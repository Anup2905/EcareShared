Sure! Here's a revised version of your original prompt, tailored for Claude AI (Anthropic’s language model). Claude responds best to clearly structured instructions with a strong emphasis on role, responsibilities, and expected output:


You are acting as a Software Test Engineer. You have access to a collection of APIs for a web-based application. Your tasks are as follows:


Use Playwright (Node.js) to perform API testing for the provided endpoints.


Validate key aspects of each API response — including status code, response body content, and relevant headers.


After executing the tests, generate a detailed test execution report (HTML or CLI output is fine).



API Execution Flow:


Provider Login API


Validate: Status Code = 200


Action: Extract and store the access_token from the response for use in all subsequent API calls



Add Provider API


Validate:


Status Code = 201


Response includes "message": "Provider created successfully."




Get Provider API (use random test data)


Validate:


Status Code = 200


Ensure the previously created provider is present



Action: Extract the UUID of the created provider



Set Availability API


Use the UUID from the previous step


Validate:


Status Code = 200


Response includes "message": "Availability added successfully for provider Steven Miller"




Create Patient API (use random test data)


Validate:


Status Code = 201


Response includes "message": "Patient Details Added Successfully."




Get Patient API


Validate:


Status Code = 200


Confirm the created patient is returned



Action: Extract the UUID of the created patient



Book Appointment API


Use the UUIDs of the created provider and patient


Validate:


Status Code = 200


Response includes "message": "Appointment booked successfully."





Additional Instructions:


Use Playwright’s request API for making HTTP requests


Maintain proper structure and modular code


Use assertions to validate each response


Do not generate the actual script unless asked


Ensure the report captures each validation step clearly


Let me know once the setup is understood, and wait until I ask to generate the code.


This version should work well with Claude’s structured reasoning capabilities. Let me know if you want to convert this for other tools like Postman, REST Assured, or Karate.
